 ðŸŽ–Write a function named calculateDogAge that:

- [ ] Takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
- [ ] Calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
- [ ] Outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!".
- [ ] Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years

```js

function dogAge(age){
    n=age*7;
 console.log("Your doggie is " + n +" years old in dog years!")
}

function dogAge1(age, rate){
    n=age*rate;
 console.log("Your doggie is " + n +" years old in dog years!")
}

```
